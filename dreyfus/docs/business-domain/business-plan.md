## Vision
Revolutionise how product development decisions are made by heavily augmenting the traditional Product Management function with an AI-driven system that absorbs massive amounts of data, from market trends to internal financials, to make high-confidence product decisions.

## Problem
- Human PMs often operate with limited or stale data, leading to less optimal product decisions.
- Misalignment between market needs and a company’s strategic direction results in wasted engineering efforts and subpar customer experiences.
- Many PMs fail to consider or accurately quantify the financial impact (ROI, profitability) of prioritisation decisions.

## Solution in Brief

### Stage 1: Data Ingestion & Roadmap Prioritization
- Ingest broad market data, user feedback, company strategy, and financials.
- Produce a highly accurate prioritised roadmap and strategy.

### Stage 2: AI-Powered Code Generation
- Use contextual code generation to implement recommended features or fixes.
- Accelerate the product development process.

## STAGE ONE: Core Features

### Real-Time Market Intelligence
- Continuous scanning of competitor releases, macro trends, and emerging technologies.
- Automated PEST (Political, Economic, Social, Technological) analysis updated weekly or monthly.

### Customer & Product Insights
- Connects to product analytics, customer surveys, feedback channels, and usage data.
- Integrates with the development pipeline, backlog, roadmaps, and feature requests.
- Synthesises pain points and emerging demands in real time.

### Strategic Alignment & Financial Modelling
- Integrates with the company’s strategy, operational and go-to-market plans.
- Assesses potential ROI for any feature.
- Ranks product opportunities based on impact to bottom-line revenue, churn reduction, or market expansion potential.

### Product Roadmap Generation
- Produces a recommended roadmap with justifications.
- Allows executive stakeholders to override or tweak priorities while displaying the cost/benefit impact.

## STAGE TWO: Extended Capabilities

### Contextual Code Generation
- Leverages the organisation’s existing repositories to suggest or create code for new features.
- Learns coding style, framework preferences, and architecture from the codebase.
- Suggests newer/better engineering practices.

### Engineer Feedback Loop
- Developers review AI-generated pull requests.
- System refines future code generation through acceptance or rejection patterns and integrated testing feedback.

### Advanced Productivity Gains
- Speeds up time-to-market by reducing friction between product ideation and engineering execution.
- Potentially lessens the need for large engineering teams over time.

## VALUE PROPOSITION & BENEFITS

### Management
- Reduced overhead, higher accuracy in roadmap decisions, clearer ROI forecasting.
- Fewer “dead-end” product initiatives.

### Engineering Teams
- Fewer misaligned or vague product requests.
- Code scaffolding to jump-start development efforts.

### Customers
- Better-aligned features that solve real problems.
- Faster, more reliable feature delivery.

## BUSINESS MODEL & FUNDING

### Initial Funding
- Either self-funded or seed-funded with innovation lab resources for MVP creation.
- Early adopter partnerships with companies seeking reduced PM or engineering overhead.

### Monetisation Approaches
- **Subscription Model (SaaS):** Tiered pricing based on data volume, requests, or feature complexity.
- **Value-Based Pricing:** Potential share of realized ROI from AI-driven recommendations.

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
- Traditional PM Tools (Aha!, Productboard, Jira) vs. AI Writing/Code Assistants (Cursor, AWS Whisper, CoPilot).
- **Differentiation:** Full pipeline integration, from market insights to actual code merges, within a single, data-driven platform.

## POTENTIAL RISKS

### Data Quality & Bias
- Over-reliance on incomplete datasets could lead to flawed decisions.
- Requires robust vetting and continuous data validation.

### Organisational Resistance
- PMs, engineering leads, or stakeholders may fear job displacement.
- Clear communication of benefits and a “human-in-the-loop” approach is vital.

### Liability & Trust
- If AI-driven decisions fail, who takes responsibility?
- Needs transparent modeling and disclaimers.

### Security & Compliance
- Handling sensitive codebases requires stringent cybersecurity measures.
- Must align with regulations like GDPR or CCPA.

## NEXT STEPS

### Sense Check
- Is this a plan worth pursuing?
- Is there an MVP we want to reach before seeking funding?
- Do we have the energy to commit?

### Build MVP
- Develop as much as possible before needing beta customers.
- In parallel, create the story for investors, partners, and the marketplace.
- When beta-ready, focus on one or two early adopter clients.

### Iterative Enhancement
- Gradually introduce AI code generation features to avoid trust issues.
- Strengthen compliance, security, and reliability.

### Scaling & Growth
- Expand to broader industry segments with tailored data pipelines and specialised domain models.
- Extend integrations (CI/CD, advanced analytics, design tools, etc.).

## QUESTIONS & THOUGHTS

### Data Coverage & Depth
- How do we ensure the AI has a truly comprehensive view of the market?
- Are there strategic or intangible “soft signals” that pure data might miss?

### Human Trust & Stakeholder Buy-In
- How do we address the trust and empathy factor an AI might lack?
- Should we position the product as a **co-pilot** or an **outright replacement** for PMs?

### Financial Impact & ROI
- Who carries the risk of a missed or failed product bet?
- How do we plan to **quantify and communicate the ROI** to executives?

### Technical Feasibility for AI Code Generation
- How do we handle code quality, version control, and regulatory compliance?
- How do we address potential **AI hallucinations** (incorrect or non-existent code suggestions)?

### Competitive Differentiation
- What’s our **unique selling point** vs. existing AI-powered PM tools?
- How will we handle the possibility that **competitors could replicate our functionality**?

### Growth, Funding, and Scalability
- Which customer segment do we plan to target first?
- Should we focus on incremental milestones or build a **full-featured** product quickly?

### Ethical & Organisational Considerations
- How do we respond to concerns about reducing PM or engineering headcount?
- Where do we draw the line between **AI-powered automation and human creativity**?
